## About

üë®‚Äçüè´ This is an educational project. The aim is to learn more about Cairo and the StarkNet ecosystem.

Swappy is like your personal financial assistant, allowing you to set up an automated token buy/sell solution to smooth out your buy/sell price.
The basic operation of Swappy is to execute orders periodically (every day, every week, ...).
However, Swappy could also execute these orders conditionally, for example, only if the average purchase price is higher than the market price (in order to lower the purchase price).

üöß It is a work in progress, and it is not ready for production.
